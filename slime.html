                <p class="novel-content">Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate
                    worker, who is perfectly
                    content
                    with his
                    monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout his
                    life.
                    In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the
                    streets
                    and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and
                    recites
                    a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.</p>

                <p>When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an
                    unfamiliar
                    realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skillsâ€”notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its
                    appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster "Storm Dragon"
                    Veldora
                    who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his
                    predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora
                    bestows
                    upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.</p>

                <p>Now, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a
                    distinct
                    goal
                    in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world,
                    gradually
                    altering his fate.</p>
